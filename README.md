# Kubernetes App Deployment

A repository where I test out kubernetes along with helm in a way that resembles a Heroku app deployment.

## The goals of this repository

The goal here is for me to learn about `Kubernetes`, `helm` and how I can use them to establish an environment to deploy apps similarly as we do at my workplace at `Heroku`.

### Dawson

Dawson is an app at my workplace that requires a few services to function. The following will be needed:

* PostgreSQL
* RabbitMQ

Dawson also needs certain helper apps to run on certain scheduled times.

## Other interesting things to try

* PR applications
* Deploy on PR merge
